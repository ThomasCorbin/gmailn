h1. GmailN - a gmail monitoring tool

This is a small tool to monitor folders on gmail.

On Ubuntu there are a fair number of gmail monitoring/notification indicator
tools.  The problem is that nearly all of them are focused solely on the
gmail inbox.  But I have tons of folders and nearly all of my email goes into
those folders, and very little in inbox.

So I want a gmail monitor which looks at folders other than inbox.

Also, I have about 90 folders, and I won't want to monitor around 10 of them,
since it's only those 10 or so folders who have the highest priority.

Typically these might be coworkers or family.

The other, lower priority folders typically correspond to mailing lists,
svn or git commit messages, email about tool or products that I use.

Right now the tool is just a command line tool that just prints out
the folders with unread emails.

As a first step, I want to have a .gmailnrc file, maybe.

As a second step, I would like to add ubuntu notify.

3rd, I might look at ubuntu indicator applet support.

h3. Cucumber/rspec

I developed this in about 10 minutes, but as I'm reading the rspec and cucumber
book, I would like to try using those on this tool.  Just as a learning experience.
